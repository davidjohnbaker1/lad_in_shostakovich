# lad_in_shostakovich

This repository has all of the code, data, and text for a backburner project looking for ways of computationally modelling ideas of lad in the music of Shostakovich.
Project will be picked up after General Exams are completed.

This project began at the start of my PhD and the old\_code directory provides a nice example (when compared to more recent repositories) of how I have improved with my coding ability over the past 2 years.
