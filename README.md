# lad_in_shostakovich

This repository has all of the code, data, and text for a backburner project looking for ways of computationally modelling ideas of lad in the music of Shostakovich.
Project will be picked up after General Exams are completed.

This project began at the start of my PhD and the old\_code directory provides a nice example (when compared to more recent repositories) of how I have improved with my coding ability over the past 2 years.

## Major To Do

* [ ] Reasses Op 34 for consistency with score
* [ ] Add in Metadata for Op 34

# Encoding Notes

* Piano parts must be encoded with own voices on MuseScore 2.
* Do not use layering, use the alt + [0-9] in encoding process
